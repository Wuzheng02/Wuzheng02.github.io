I am Zheng Wu, a senior undergraduate student at the School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I will receive my Bachelor's degree in 2025 and will continue my studies as a Master's student under the supervision of Prof. Zhuosheng Zhang. 

My research interests include natural language processing, (multimodal) large language models, and computer-using agents.
