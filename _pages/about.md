My name is **Zheng Wu**, and I am currently a Master’s student at the School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. **Zhuosheng Zhang**. I received my Bachelor’s degree from the same institution in 2025. I also will continue my academic journey by transitioning into the Ph.D. program advised by Prof. Zhuosheng Zhang.

My research interests include natural language processing, (multimodal) large language models, and GUI agents.
